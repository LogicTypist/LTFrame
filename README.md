LogicTypist's Frame for R216.
-----------------------------

LTFrame is literally a software frame for [LBPHacker's R216 computer](https://powdertoy.co.uk/Browse/View.html?ID=2303519).

This is having very initial step, so its not working now.

The concept of LTFrame is as follows.

LTFrame Core region
 - init

System Library region
 - runtime memory allocation (memory allocation only. excluding protection, management)
 - data structure

Peripherals Library region
 - r2term
 - random number generator
 - ..etc

Other Library region

 - ..etc

MainApp region
 - Applications...

This project is just for fun. :)
